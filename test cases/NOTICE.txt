1. The record.txt and sale.txt in the folders of test cases are UPDATED after running the program, not the original ones.
2. For the record.txt and sale.txt, only the files updated will be shown in test cases folders.
   - For example, since using searching will not make any changes to the record.txt and sale.txt, 
     we do not provide the record.txt and sales.txt, as they remain the same before and after running the program.
   - For example, when inserting new item, the item has not saled before and so no changes are made to sale.txt, 
     so only record.txt is provided.
3. Since we want to save memory space, if there is any update for demand or status, they will be updated when running the        main.cpp AGAIN after making changes to inventory.
   This explains why there are two record.txt in update test case 2 folder.
   - record (after running test) will only update attributes excluding demand and status
   - record (run main.cpp again, after running the test) will show updates in all attributes, including demand and status.

Thank you for your attention!
